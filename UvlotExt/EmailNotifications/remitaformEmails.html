        <p>Your application for a NYSC loan from CashNowNow is in the final stage of processing.  However, in order to disburse the funds we require you to activate a standing order with your bank and sign the attestation letter.  The standing order will be used to automatically deduct your monthly payment during the period of the loan.  See summary details below;</p>
       <p> Loan Amount:<strong>(&#8358;)20,000</strong><br />
           Loan Tenure: 2 months<br />
           Monthly Repayment Amount:<strong>(&#8358;)12,450</strong><br />

</p>
        <p>
        <p>
            Loan Amount:<strong>(&#8358;)20,000</strong><br />
<p>
            Loan Amount:<strong>(&#8358;)20,000</strong><br />
            Note: The amount on the REMITA standing order (see link below) includes an additional monthly payment amount of (&#8358;)12,450.  The company will only deduct this from this amount if the loan is in default (see terms and conditions for more details)
        </p>

            <p></p>

            <p> Print and sign the REMITA standing order and take to your nearest bank branch.  Let them know you wish to activate a REMITA standing order.  Once activated by the bank we will receive a notification and an email will be sent to you. Note that Remita standing order is to be activated before 22nd day of the month. Failure to do so warrants submission of new loan application.</p>

            <p> Print and sign the attestation letter, login to your dashboard using login details sent to your email and upload for documentation.</p>

            <p> Funds will be disbursed within 24 hours of standing order activation and signed attestation letter upload.  If you have any further questions please contact customercare@cashnownow.net or contact us via telephone or WhatsApp on 0907 333 3484 or 0901 424 2062</p>
